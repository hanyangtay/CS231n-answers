## Credits

I am deeply grateful to the Stanford team, who generously decided to make the course materials public. As somebody who tried to self- learn neural networks from other online tutorials, I really admire the way the course was structured and the pedagogical approach behind it. It was definitely difficult, but I learned so much.
