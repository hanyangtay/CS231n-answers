## Credits

I am deeply grateful to the Stanford team, who generously decided to make the course materials public. As somebody who tried to self- learn neural networks from other online tutorials, I really admire the way the course was structured and the pedagogical approach behind it. It was definitely difficult, but I learned so much.

In this course, there were difficult problems that I mulled over for several hours. There were a few resources that were particularly helpful, especially Cl√©ment Thorey's [solutions](https://github.com/cthorey/CS231) to the course, as well as kratzert's [explanation of the computational graph of the batch normalisation layer](https://kratzert.github.io/2016/02/12/understanding-the-gradient-flow-through-the-batch-normalization-layer.html). I'd highly recommend reading through their code, as for some problems, their answers inspired cleaner code on my side.
